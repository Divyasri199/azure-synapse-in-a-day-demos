## Exercise 9: End processing

Time required: 5 minutes

You have reached the end of the lab. Follow the steps below to end processing and pause the SQL pool to save costs if you need to keep the lab environment available for additional labs.

> **Note**: If you no longer need the lab environment, delete the `synapse-lab-infrastructure` resource group to remove all lab resources.

### Task 1: Pause the SQL pool

1. Return to Synapse Studio (<https://web.azuresynapse.net/>) and select the **Manage** hub.

<!-- ## Appendix

### Native scoring with T-SQL PREDICT

You can use the T-SQL PREDICT function by registering a learned model created with Azure ML or Spark ML with SQL Pool. This feature allows data batch scoring on your data warehouse without having to navigate out of Synapse Studio.

#### Register model files

Import the model file with SQL. To do this, use the `ETLandPREDICT/RegisterModel.sql` file. -->
